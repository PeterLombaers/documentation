<p>For an introduction to nearest neighbor search see
<a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">Nearest Neighbor Search</a> documentation.
See also the <a href="performance/practical-nearest-neighbor-search.html">
  practical nearest neighbor search guide</a> for a step by step guide. 
This document describes how to speed up searches for nearest neighbors by adding a
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#index-hnsw">HNSW index</a> to the tensor field.
Vespa implements a modified version of
the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs algorithm (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">paper</a>).
The implementation in Vespa supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta Data Filtering</strong> - The search for nearest neighbors can be constrained by query filters
as the nearest neighbor search in Vespa is expressed as a query operator.
The query operator can be combined with other filters or query terms using the
<a href="query-language.html">Vespa query language</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Real Time Indexing</strong> - Add, remove and update vectors in the index with low latency,
using the <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#tensor">document JSON format for tensors</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Mutable HNSW Index</strong> - This ensures no query overhead from having to search multiple <em>HNSW</em> indexes.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-threaded Indexing</strong> - The costly part when doing changes to the index is searching the graph layers
to find which parts to change. This is handled by multiple threads, controlled by the
<a href="reference/services-content.html#feeding-concurrency">feeding concurrency</a> setting.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-vespas-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search">Using Vespa's approximate nearest neighbor search</h2>
<p>
The query examples in <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> uses the brute force variant which has
perfect accuracy but which is computationally expensive for large document volumes
as the distance needs to be calculated for every document which matches
the query filters. 

To enable fast approximate matching, the tensor needs an <em>index</em> directive.
The same document type can have multiple <em>HNSW</em> indexes:</p>
<pre>
field image_sift_encoding type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[128]) {
  indexing: summary | attribute | index
  attribute {
    distance-metric: euclidean 
  }
  index {
    hnsw {
      max-links-per-node: 16
      neighbors-to-explore-at-insert: 500
    }
  }
}

field bert_embedding type tensor&lt;float&gt;(x[384]) {
  indexing: summary | attribute | index
  attribute {
    distance-metric: angular
  }
  index {
    hnsw {
      max-links-per-node: 24
      neighbors-to-explore-at-insert: 500
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>In the example above, fast approximate search is enabled by building an <em>HNSW</em> index over the
<em>image_sift_encoding</em> and the <em>bert_embedding</em> tensor fields.

The two fields uses different <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric">distance-metric</a>
and <em>max-links-per-node</em> settings. 

See <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#index-hnsw">HNSW index reference</a> for details on the index parameters.
Choosing the value of these parameters affects both accuracy, query speed, and also indexing performance.</p>

<p>The tensors used in queries must have their type declared in a query profile in the application package
as discussed in the <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">exact nearest neighbor search</a> document. 


<h3 id="approximate-nearest-neighbor-query">Using fast approximate nearest neighbor search in query</h3>

<p>With an <em>HNSW</em> index enabled on the tensor field one can choose between approximate
or exact (brute-force) search by using the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#approximate">approximate</a> annotation:</p>
<pre>
{
  "yql": "select title,price from sources * where ({targetHits: 10, approximate:false}nearestNeighbor(image_sift_encoding,query_vector_sift)) and in_stock = true",
  "hits": 100
  "ranking.features.query(query_vector_sift)": [0.21,0.12,....],
  "ranking.profile": "image_similarity" 
}
</pre>
<p>By default, <em>approximate</em> is true when searching a tensor with a <em>HNSW</em> index.</p>
<p>
The <em>approximate</em> parameter allows computing the accuracy loss
by computing the exact neighbors and compare with the approximation to compute the accuracy metric (e.g., recall@k).
</p>
<p>
In addition to <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#targethits">targetHits</a>,
there is a <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#hnsw-exploreadditionalhits">hnsw.exploreAdditionalHits</a> parameter
which controls how many extra nodes in the graph (in addition to <em>targetHits</em>)
that are explored during the graph search.
</p>
<p>
Using a greater number gives better quality (accuracy as compared with the brute force) but worse performance.
</p>
<pre>
{
  "yql": "select title,price from sources * where ({targetHits: 10, hnsw.exploreAdditionalHits:100}nearestNeighbor(image_sift_encoding,query_vector_sift)) and in_stock = true",
  "hits": 10,
  "ranking.features.query(query_vector_sift)": [0.21,0.12,....],
  "ranking.profile": "image_similarity" 
}
</pre>



<h2 id="nearest-neighbor-search-considerations">Nearest Neighbor Search Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>When using the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#nearestneighbor">nearestNeighbor</a>
operator the total hit count is not accurate.
This is similar to the behavior with
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weakand">weakAnd</a> and
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#wand">wand</a>.
This is true for both approximate and brute force.</li>
<li>When using the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#nearestneighbor">nearestNeighbor</a>
operator the <a href="grouping.html">grouping</a> counts are not accurate. </li>
<li>Changing the
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric">distance-metric</a>
for a tensor field with an <em>HNSW</em> index requires
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#changes-that-require-restart-but-not-re-feed">re-starting</a>.
Similar, changing the <em>max-links-per-node</em> and <em>neighbors-to-explore-at-insert</em> requires re-starting.</li>
<li>Vespa tensor fields are in-memory data structures and so is the HNSW index.
For large datasets the primary memory footprint driver is the raw tensor field.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="scaling-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search">Scaling Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</h2>
<p>The HNSW search algorithm is sub-linear (close to log(N)), this has interesting properties when attempting to add more
nodes horizontally as even if the document volume per node is reduced by a factor of 10, the latency is only reduced by 50%. 
Pure HNSW search applications should attempt to scale up by using a larger flavor and try to maximize the number of vectors 
per node. To scale with throughput (query volume) add groups (replicas). See <a href="performance/sizing-search.html">Sizing search</a>.

<p>Using lower precision, for example using bfloat16 instead of float saves 50% memory usage, which enables putting more documents per node.</p>
