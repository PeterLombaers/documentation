<p>
To model position(s) in documents, use field(s) of type
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:position">position</a>.
Use this to limit hits to within an area, or use the distance from a position in rank functions.
Sample schema:
<pre>
schema local {
    document local {
        field title type string {
            indexing: index
        }
        field location type <span class="pre-hilite">position</span> {
            indexing: attribute
        }
    }
    fieldset default {
        fields: title
    }
}
</pre><pre>
[
    {
        "put": "id:localnamespace:local::business-1",
        "fields": {
            "title" :    "Random pizza place",
            "location" : "N37.401;W121.996"
        }
    }
]
</pre>


<h2 id="restrict">Restrict</h2>
<p>
The preferred API for adding a geographical restriction is to use a
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#geolocation">geoLocation</a> clause in the YQL statement, example:
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where title contains \"pizza\" and geoLocation(location, 37.416383, -122.024683, \"20 miles\")"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/
</pre>
<p>
You can also build or modify the query programmatically by adding a
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/GeoLocationItem.html">GeoLocationItem</a>
anywhere in the query tree.
</p>
<p>
To allow the query location to match any position, specify a negative
radius (e.g. "-1 m").  But to use a position for ranking only
(without any requirement for a matching position)
you should also specify it as a ranking-only term.  Use the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#rank">rank()</a>
operation in YQL, or a
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/RankItem.html">RankItem</a>
when building the query programmatically.
</p>
<p>
There is also a set of <em>legacy</em> parameters in the query API that may be used to
<a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#geographical-searches">restrict query results</a>,
defining the allowed area using a position + radius or a bounding box.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Restrict search results using <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#geographical-searches">pos.ll</a> and default radius (50km):
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where title contains \"pizza\""}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/?pos.ll=N37.416383%3BW122.024683
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Set a different <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#pos.radius">pos.radius</a>:
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where title contains \"pizza\""}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/?pos.ll=N37.416383%3BW122.024683&amp;pos.radius=5km
</pre>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="rank">Rank</h2>
<p>
The corresponding rank features for this example are
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name)">distance(latlong)</a> or
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#closeness(name)">closeness(latlong)</a> or
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#closeness(name).logscale">closeness(latlong).logscale</a> -
the last is probably the most useful when combining distance ranking with textual relevance ranking.
</p>



<h2 id="summary-fields">Summary fields</h2>
<p>
See the <a href="reference/document-json-format.html#position">reference</a>
for rendering options.
</p><p>
If the request specifies a <em>position</em>,
the distance to this position is calculated and rendered in <em>fieldname.distance</em>.
For documents with multiple positions in the attribute, the distance to the nearest position is returned.
</p>


<h3 id="x-y">X/Y</h3>
<p>
"x" and "y" are integers - these are in millionths of a degree - about 10 cm.
Also note which is which of "x" and "y":
</p><img src="/assets/img/geo/Mercator_projection.jpg" height="407" width="480" alt="world map"><p>
It's just putting a normal coordinate system on top of the world map,
so "x" is the longitude (east-west) and "y" the latitude (north-south).
</p><p>
The third summary field is the distance, also as an integer, and also in millionths of degrees.
When converting to internal units (millionths of degrees), the Earth polar radius is used,
so <code>degrees = 180.0 * meters / (Math.PI * 6356752.0);</code> is the basic conversion formula.
</p>


<h3 id="summary-features">summary-features</h3>
<p>
Instead of sending the position and the computed distance in a summary field,
it may be more practical to add some of the associated rank features as
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
In particular,
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).latitude">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).latitude</a>
and
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).longitude">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).longitude</a>
gives the geographical coordinates directly, in degrees.
This is especially useful to use these programmatically from a searcher, accessing
<a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#accessing-feature-function-values-in-results">feature values in results</a>
for further processing.
</p>



<h2>Using multiple position fields</h2>
<p>
For some applications, it can be useful to have several position attributes that may be searched.
For example an address book application could use positions for home address and work address.
This is possible to declare without any special considerations in the schema file,
but needs some extra handling on the query side.
A single query item can only search in one of the position attributes,
and with the legacy API must specify which attribute with a
<a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#pos.attribute">pos.attribute</a> query parameter.
If you want to have a search that spans several fields,
use YQL to combine several <code>geoLocation</code> items inside an <code>or</code> clause,
or combine several fields into a combined array field:
<pre>
schema address {
    document address {
        field homeaddress type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
        field homelatlong type position {
            indexing: attribute
        }
        field workaddress type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
        field worklatlong type position {
            indexing: attribute
        }
        field bothlatlong type array&lt;position&gt; {
            indexing: attribute
        }
    }
    field bothaddress type string {
        indexing: input homeaddress . " " . input workaddress | index
    }
}
</pre>
Here we assume that the home fields will contain the address and position of your house,
the work fields the address and position of your workplace,
while the <em>bothlatlong</em> field is assumed to be filled with
the positions of both house and workplace (before feeding data into Vespa, or in a
document processor during feeding).
In a query it's then possible to say
<pre>
search/?query=homeaddress:sunnyvale&amp;pos.attribute=homelatlong&amp;pos.ll=N37.416383%3BW122.024683&amp;pos.radius=5km
</pre>
which is unlikely to give many hits, since it's mostly a business district around Yahoo! headquarters, while
<pre>
search/?query=workaddress:sunnyvale&amp;pos.attribute=worklatlong&amp;pos.ll=N37.416383%3BW122.024683&amp;pos.radius=5km
</pre>
<p>
would show lots of people working in Sunnyvale;
use <em>pos.attribute=bothlatlong</em> for cases where it's uncertain if home
address or work address position was wanted.
</p>



<h2 id="distance-to-path">Distance to path</h2>
<p>
This example provides an overview of the
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distanceToPath(name).distance">DistanceToPath</a>
rank feature. This feature matches <em>document locations</em> to a path given in the query.
Not only does this feature return the closest distance for each document to the path,
it also includes the length traveled <em>along</em> the path before reaching the closest point,
or <em>intersection</em>. This feature has been nick named the
<em>gas</em> feature because of its obvious use case of finding
gas stations along a planned trip.
</p><p>
In this example we have been traveling from the US to Bangalore, and we
are now planning our trip back. We have decided to rent a car in
Bangalore that we are to return upon arrival at the airport in
Chennai. We are already quite hungry and wish to stop for a meal once
we are outside of town. To avoid having to pay an additional fueling
premium, we also wish to refuel just before reaching the airport. We
need to figure out what roads to take, what restaurants are available
outside of Bangalore, and what fuel stations are available once we get
close to Chennai.
In <em>figure 1</em> we have plotted our trip from
Bangalore to the airport:
</p><img src="/assets/img/geo/path1.png" alt="Trip from Bangalore to the airport"/><p>
If we search for restaurants along the path,
we only see a small subset of all restaurants present in the window of
our quite large map. In <em>figure 2</em> you see how the most
relevant results are actually all in Bangalore or Chennai:
</p><img src="/assets/img/geo/path2.png" alt="Most relevant results"/><p>
To find the best results, move the map
window to just about where we expect to be eating, and redo the search:
</p><img src="/assets/img/geo/path3.png" alt="redo search with adjusted map"/><p>
This has to be done similarly for
finding a gas station near the airport.
This illustrates searching for restaurants in a smaller window along the
planned trip without <em>DistanceToPath</em>.
Next, we outline how <em>DistanceToPath</em>
 can be used to quickly and easily improve this type of
planning to be more convenient for the user.
</p><p>
The nature of this feature requires that the search corpus contains documents with position data.
A <a href="searcher-development.html">searcher component</a> needs to be
written that is able to pass paths with the queries that lie in the
same coordinate space as the searchable documents.
Finally, a <a href="ranking.html">rank-profile</a> needs to defined that scores
documents according to how they match some target distance traveled
and at the same time lies close "enough" to the path.
</p>


<h3 id="query-syntax">Query Syntax</h3>
<p>
This document does not describe how to write a searcher plugin for the
JDisc Container, refer to the <a href="searcher-development.html">container documentation</a>.
However, let us review the syntax expected by <em>DistanceToPath</em>.
As noted in the the <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distanceToPath(name).distance">
rank features reference</a>,
the path is supplied as a query parameter by name of the feature and the <code>path</code> keyword:
<pre>
yql=(&hellip;)&amp;rankproperty.distanceToPath(<em>name</em>).path=(x1,y1,x2,y2,&hellip;,xN,yN)
</pre>
<p>
Here <code>name</code> has to match the name of the position attribute that holds the positions data.
</p><p>
The path itself is parsed as a list of <code>N</code> coordinate pairs
that together form <code>N-1</code> line segments:
</p><p><!-- depends on mathjax -->
$$(x_1,y_1) \rightarrow (x_2,y_2), (x_2,y_2) \rightarrow (x_3,y_3), (&hellip;), (x_{N-1},y_{N-1}) \rightarrow (x_N,y_N)$$
</p>
  {% include note.html content="The path is <em>not</em> in a readable (longitude, latitude) format,
  but is a pair of integers in the internal format (degrees multiplied by 1 million).
  If a transform is required from geographic coordinates to this, the search plugin must do it;
  note that the first number in each pair (the 'x') is longitude (degrees East or West)
  while the second ('y') is latitude (degrees North or South), corresponding to the usual orientation for maps -
  <em>opposite</em> to the usual order of latitude/longitude."%}


<h3 id="rank-profile">Rank profile</h3>
<p>
If we were to disregard our scenario for a few moments, we could
suggest the following rank profile:
<pre>
rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
        expression: nativeRank
    }
    second-phase {
        expression: firstPhase * if (distanceToPath(ll).distance &lt; 10000, 1, 0)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This profile will first rank all documents according to Vespa's
<em>nativeRank</em> feature, and then do a second pass over the top 100
results and order these based on their distance to our path. 
If a document lies within 100 metres of our path it
retains its relevancy, otherwise its relevancy is set to 0.  Such a
rank profile would indeed solve the current problem,
but Vespa's ranking model allows for us to take this a lot further.
</p><p>
The following is a rank profile that ranks documents
according to a query-specified target distance to path and distance traveled:
<pre>
rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
        expression {
            max(0,    query(distance) - distanceToPath(ll).distance) *
            (1 - fabs(query(traveled) - distanceToPath(ll).traveled))
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The expression is two-fold; a first component determines a rank based
on the document's distance to the given path as compared to
the <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">query parameter</a>
<code>distance</code>. If the allowed distance is exceeded, this
component's contribution is 0. The distance contribution is then
multiplied by the difference of the actual distance traveled as
compared to the query parameter <code>traveled</code>. In short, this
profile will include all documents that lie close enough to the path,
ranked according to their actual distance and traveled measure.
</p>
{% include note.html content="<em>DistanceToPath</em> is only compatible
with <em>2D coordinates</em> because pathing in 1 dimension makes no sense."%}


<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>
For the sake of this example, assume that we have implemented a
custom path searcher that is able to pass the path found by the user's
initial directions query to Vespa's <a href="#query-syntax">query syntax</a>.
There are then two more parameters that must be supplied
by the user; <code>distance</code> and <code>traveled</code>. Vespa
expects these parameters to be supplied in a scale compatible with the
feature's output, and should probably also be mapped by the container  
plugin. The feature's <em>distance</em> output is given in
Vespa's internal resolution, which is approximately 10 units per
meter. The <em>traveled</em> output is a normalized number
between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the beginning of the path, and 1
is the end of the path.
</p><p>
This illustrates how these parameters can be used to return
the most appropriate hits for our scenario. Note that the figures only
show the top hit for each query:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path4.png" alt="Top tip 1"/>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path5.png" alt="Top tip 2"/>
<ol>
  <li>Searching for restaurants with the DistanceToPath feature.
    <code>distance = 1000, traveled = 0.1</code></li>
  <li>Searching for gas stations with the DistanceToPath feature.
    <code>distance = 1000, traveled = 0.9</code></li>
</ol>
