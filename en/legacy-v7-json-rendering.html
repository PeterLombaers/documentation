<p>

There were some inconsistencies between search results and document rendering in Vespa 7
which are fixed in Vespa 8.  This document describes the old behavior, what the changes
are, and how to configure if you need to select a specific rendering.

<h2 id="wset-rendering">Fixed: Inconsistent weightedset rendering</h2>
<p>
Fields with various weightedset types has a JSON input representation (for feeding) as
a JSON object; for example <code>{"one":1, "two":2,"three":3}</code> for
the value of a a <code>weightedset&lt;string&gt;</code> field.
The same format is used when rendering a document (for example when visiting).
</p>
<p>
In search results however, there are intermediate processing steps during which the
field value is represented as an array of item/weight pairs, so in a search results
the field value would render as
<code>[ {"item":"one", "weight":1},
        {"item":"two", "weight":2},
        {"item":"three", "weight":3} ]</code>
</p>
<p>
In Vespa 8, the default JSON renderer for search results will output the same
as document rendering.  If you have code that depends on the old format you can
(for a limited time) turn off this by setting <code>renderer.json.jsonWsets=false</code>
in the query (usually via a <a href="query-profiles.html">query profile</a>).
</p>


<h2 id="map-rendering">Fixed: Inconsistent map rendering</h2>
<p>
Fields with various map types has a JSON input representation (for feeding) as
a JSON object; for example <code>{"1001":1.0, "1002":2.0, "1003":3.0}</code> for
the value of a a <code>map&lt;int,float&gt;</code> field.
The same format is used when rendering a document (for example when visiting).
</p>
<p>
In search results however, there are intermediate processing steps and the field value
is represented as an array of key/value pairs, so in a search results the field
value would (in some cases) render as
<code>[ {"key":1001, "value":1.0},
        {"key":1002, "value":2.0},
        {"key":1003, "value":3.0} ]</code>
</p>
<p>
In Vespa 8, the default JSON renderer for search results will output the same
as document rendering.  If you have code that depends on the old format you can
(for a limited time) turn off this by setting <code>renderer.json.jsonMaps=false</code>
in the query (usually via a <a href="query-profiles.html">query profile</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="geo-position-rendering">Changed: Geo position rendering</h2>
<p>
Fields with the type <code>position</code> would in Vespa 7 be rendered
using the internal fields "x" and "y". These are integers representing microdegrees,
aka geographical degrees times 1 million, of longitude (for x) and latitude (for y).
Also, any field <em>foo</em> of type <code>position</code> would trigger addition of
two extra synthetic summary fields <em>foo.position</em> and <em>foo.distance</em>
(see below for details).
</p>
<p>
In Vespa 8, positions will be rendered with two JSON fields "lat" and "lng",
both having a floating-point value.
The "lat" field is latitude (going from -90.0 at the south pole
to +90.0 at the north pole).
The "lng" field is longitude (going from -180.0 at the dateline
seen as extreme west, via 0.0 at the Greenwich meridian, to +180.0
at the dateline again, now as extreme east).
The field names are chosen so the format is the same as used in the
Google "places" API.
</p>
<p>
It's possible to switch back to the legacy (Vespa 7) rendering for geo positions.
Set the flag to true by adding the following below the root <code>services</code> element in services.xml:
      <pre class="code">
        &lt;legacy&gt;
          &lt;v7-geo-positions&gt;true&lt;/v7-geo-positions&gt;
        &lt;/legacy&gt;
      </pre>
</p>
<p>
Note that this flag affects rendering both in documents fetched/visited, and
in search results; but both the new and old formats are accepted as feed input.
</p>
<p>
A closely related change is the removal of two synthetic summary fields
which would be returned in search results.  For example with this in schema:
<pre class="code">
        field mainloc type position {
            indexing: attribute | summary
        }
</pre>
Vespa 7 would include the <em>mainloc</em> summary field, but also
<em>mainloc.position</em> and <em>mainloc.distance</em>; the latter
only when the query actually had a position to take the distance from.
</p>
<p>
The first of these (<em>mainloc.position</em> in this case) was
mainly useful for producing XML output in older Vespa versions, and
now contains just the same information as the <em>mainloc</em>
summary field.  The second (<em>mainloc.distance</em> in this case)
would return a distance in internal units, and can be replaced by
a summary feature - here <code>distance(mainloc)</code> would
give the same number, while <code>distance(mainloc).km</code> would
be the recommended replacement with suitable code changes.
<p>


<h2 id="feature-data">Summary-features wrapped in "rankingExpression"</h2>
<p>
In Vespa 7, if your rank profile wanted a function
<code>foobar</code> returned in summary-features (or match-features),
it would be rendered as <code>rankingExpression(foobar)</code> in
the output.
</p>
<p>
For programmatic use, the <code>FeatureData</code> class has
extra checking to allow lookup with
<code>getDouble("foobar")</code> or
<code>getTensor("foobar")</code>, but now it's present and rendered
with just the original name as specified.
</p>
<p>
If your applications needs the JSON rendering to look exactly
as in Vespa 7, you can specify that in the rank profile.
For example, with this in your schema:
    <pre class="code">
	rank-profile whatever {
		function lengthScore() { expression: matchCount(title)/fieldLength(title) }
		summary-features {
			matchCount(title)
			lengthScore
			...
    </pre>
could, in Vespa 7, yield JSON output containing:
    <pre class="code">
	summaryfeatures: {
		matchCount(title): 1,
		rankingExpression(lengthScore): 0.25,
		...
    </pre>
in Vespa 8, you would instead get the expected:
    <pre class="code">
	summaryfeatures: {
		matchCount(title): 1,
		lengthScore: 0.25,
		...
    </pre>
But to get the old behavior you can specify:
    <pre class="code">
	rank-profile whatever {
		function lengthScore() { expression: matchCount(title)/fieldLength(title) }
		summary-features {
			matchCount(title)
			rankingExpression(lengthScore)
			...
    </pre>
which gives you the same output as before, if you really need that.
