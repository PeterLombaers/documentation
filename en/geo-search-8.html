<h2 id="position-fields">The position type</h2>
<p>
To model a geographical position in documents, use a field where the type is
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#type:position">position</a> for
a single, required position.  To allow any number of positions
(including none at all) use <code>array&lt;position&gt;</code> instead.
This can be used to limit hits (only those documents with a position
inside a circular area will be hits), the distance from a point can
be used as input to ranking functions, or both.
</p>
<p>
A geographical point in Vespa is specified using the geographical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>.
As an example, a location in
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/721+1st+Ave,+Sunnyvale,+CA+94089/@37.4181488,-122.0256157,12z">
Sunnyvale, California</a>
could be latitude 37.4181488 degrees North, longitude 122.0256157 degrees West.
This would be represented as
<code>{ "lat": 37.4181488, "lng": -122.0256157 }</code>
in JSON.
</p>
<p>
As seen above, positive numbers are used for north (latitudes) and
east (longitudes); negative numbers are used for south and west.
This is the usual convention.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Old formats for position (those used in Vespa 5, 6, and 7)
are still accepted as feed input; enabling legacy output is
temporarily possible also.  See
<a href="legacy-v7-json-rendering.html#geo-position-rendering">legacy flag v7-geo-positions</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="sample">Sample schema and document</h2>
<p>
A sample schema could be a business directory, where every
business has a position (for its main office or contact point):
</p>
<pre>
schema biz {
    document biz {
        field title type string {
            indexing: index
        }
        field mainloc type <span class="pre-hilite">position</span> {
            indexing: attribute | summary
        }
    }
    fieldset default {
        fields: title
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Using this schema is one possible business entry with its location:
</p>
<pre class=code>
    {
        "put": "id:mynamespace:biz::business-1",
        "fields": {
            "title":      "Yahoo Inc (main office)",
            "mainloc":    { "lat": 37.4181488, "lng": -122.0256157 }
        }
    }
</pre>


<h2 id="restrict">Restrict</h2>
<p>
The API for adding a geographical restriction is to use a
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#geolocation">geoLocation</a>
clause in the YQL statement, specifying a point and a maximum
distance from that point:
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where title contains \"office\" and geoLocation(mainloc, 37.416383, -122.024683, \"20 miles\");"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/
</pre>
<p>
You can also build or modify the query programmatically by adding a
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/GeoLocationItem.html">GeoLocationItem</a>
anywhere in the query tree.
</p>
<p>
To use a position for ranking only (without <em>any</em> requirement for a
matching position), you should specify it as a ranking-only term.
Use the
<a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#rank">rank()</a>
operation in YQL for this, or a
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/RankItem.html">RankItem</a>
when building the query programmatically.
</p>
At the <em>same time</em>, specify a negative radius (for example "-1 m").
This matches any position, and computes distance etc. for the closest position in the document.
Example:
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where rank(title contains \"office\", geoLocation(mainloc, 37.416383, -122.024683, \"-1 m\"));"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/
</pre>

<h2 id="rank">Ranking from a position match</h2>
<p>
The main rank feature to use for the example above would be
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).km">distance(mainloc).km</a>
and doing further calculation on it, giving better rank to documents
that are closer to the wanted (query) position.  Here one needs to
take into consideration what sort of distances are practical;
traveling on foot, by car, or by plane should have quite different
ranking scales - using different ranking profiles would be one natural
way to support that.  If the query specifies a maximum distance, that
could be sent as an input to ranking as well, and used for scaling.
</p>
<p>
There is also a <a
href="reference/rank-features.html#closeness(name)">closeness(mainloc)</a>
which goes from 1.0 at the exact location to 0.0 at a tunable maximum
distance, which is enough for many needs.
</p>

<h3 id="summary-features">Useful summary-features</h3>
<p>
To do further processing, it may be useful to get the computed distance back.
The preferred way to do this is to use the associated rank features as
<a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
In particular,
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).km">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).km</a>
gives the geographical distance in kilometers, while
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).latitude">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).latitude</a>
and
<a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).longitude">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).longitude</a>
gives the geographical coordinates for the best location directly, in degrees.
These are easy to use programmatically from a searcher, accessing
<a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#accessing-feature-function-values-in-results">feature values in results</a>
for further processing.
</p>

<h2>Using multiple position fields</h2>
<p>
For some applications, it can be useful to have several position attributes that may be searched.
For example, we could expand the above examples with the locations of subsidiary offices:
<pre>
schema biz {
    document biz {
        field title type string {
            indexing: index
        }
        field mainloc type <span class="pre-hilite">position</span> {
            indexing: attribute | summary
        }
        field otherlocs type <span class="pre-hilite">array&lt;position&gt;</span> {
            indexing: attribute
        }
    }
    fieldset default {
        fields: title
    }
}
</pre>
Expanding the example business with an office in Australia and one in Norway
could look like:
<pre class=code>
    {
        "put": "id:mynamespace:biz::business-1",
        "fields": {
            "title":       "Yahoo Inc (some offices)",
            "mainloc":     { "lat": 37.4, "lng": -122.0 },
            "otherlocs": [ { "lat": -33.9, "lng": 151.2 },
                           { "lat": 63.4, "lng": 10.4 } ]
        }
    }
</pre>
A single query item can only search in one of the position attributes.
If you want to have a search that spans several fields,
use YQL to combine several <code>geoLocation</code> items inside
an <code>or</code> clause, or combine several fields into a combined
array field (so in the above example, you could duplicate the
"mainloc" position into the "otherlocs" array as well, possible
changing the name from "otherlocs" to "all_locs").

<h2>Example with airport positions</h2>
