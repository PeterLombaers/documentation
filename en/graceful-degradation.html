<p>
Ideally one want to query all data indexed in a Vespa cluster within the specified timeout,
but that might not be possible for different reasons:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The system might be overloaded due to capacity constraints,
        and queries do not complete within the timeout,
        as they are sitting in the queue (Little's Law)</li>
	<li>A complex query might take longer time to execute than the specified timeout,
        or the timeout is too low given the complexity of the query and available capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>
This document describes how Vespa could gracefully degrade the result set
if the query cannot be completed within the timeout specified. Definitions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Coverage</strong>: The percentage of documents indexed which were evaluated by the query.
        Ideally coverage is 100%</li>
    <li> <strong>Timeout</strong>: The total time a query is allowed to run for.
        Vespa is a distributed system where multiple components are involved in the query execution</li>
    <li> <strong>Soft Timeout</strong>: Soft timeout is a Vespa configuration switch which allows coverage to be less than 100%,
        but bigger than 0% if the query is going to time out. E.g. return current hit set when time budget is used</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="timeouts">Timeouts</h2>
<p>
Vespa's default query timeout is 500 ms and soft timeout is enabled per default -
reference documentation:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#timeout">timeout</a></li>
<li><a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.softtimeout">ranking.softtimeout</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The <em>timeout</em> specifies the overall timeout of the query execution
and can be configured and also overridden by the <em>timeout</em> run time request parameter,
or defined in a <a href="query-profiles.html">query profile</a>
so that different classes of queries can have a different latency budget/timeout.
</p><p>
The <em>softtimeout</em> setting controls what the content nodes should do
in the case where the latency budget has almost been used (timeout times a factor).
Return the documents recalled and ranked with the
<a href="phased-ranking.html">first phase function</a> within the time used,
or simply don't produce a result:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>With <em>softtimeout</em> disabled, the Vespa container will return a 504 timeout without any results.</li>
  <li>When enabled, it will return the documents matched and ranked up until the timeout was reached,
    with a 200 OK response along with the reason the result set was degraded.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The container might respond with a timeout error with HTTP response code 504 even with <em>softtimeout</em> enabled
  if the timeout is set so low that the query does not make it to the content nodes,
  or the container does not have any time left after input and query processing
  to dispatch the query to the content nodes.
</p>



<h2 id="detection">Detection</h2>
<p>
The default JSON renderer template will always render a <em>coverage</em> element below the root element,
which has a <em>degraded</em> element if the query execution was degraded in some way
and the <em>coverage</em> field will be less than 100.
Example request with a query timeout of 200 ms and <em>ranking.softtimeout.enable=true</em>:
</p>
<pre>
/search/?searchChain=vespa&yql=select * from sources * where foo contains bar&presentation.format=json&timeout=200ms&ranking.softtimeout.enable=true

{
    "root": {
        "coverage": {
            "coverage": 99,
            "degraded": {
                "adaptive-timeout": false,
                "match-phase": false,
                "non-ideal-state": false,
                "timeout": true
            },
            "documents": 167006201,
            "full": false,
            "nodes": 11,
            "results": 1,
            "resultsFull": 0
        },
        "fields": {
            "totalCount": 16469732
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The result was delivered in 200 ms but the query was degraded as coverage is less than 100
(not all available documents searched and ranked within the specified timeout of 200ms).
In this case, 167006201 out of x documents where queried, and 16469732 documents where matched and ranked,
using the first-phase ranking expression in the default rank profile.
</p><p>
The <em>degraded</em> field contains the following fields which explains why the result had coverage less than 100:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>adaptive-timeout</em> is true if <a href="reference/services-content.html#coverage">Adaptive coverage</a>
      has been enabled and one or more nodes fail to produce a result at all within the timeout.
      This could be caused by nodes with degraded hardware making them slower than others in the cluster</li>
  <li><em>match-phase</em> is true if the rank profile has defined
      <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match-phase">match phase ranking degradation</a>.
      Match-phase can be used to control which documents are ranked within the timeout</li>
  <li><em>non-ideal-state</em> is true in cases where the system is not in
    <a href="content/idealstate.html">ideal state</a></li>
  <li><em>timeout</em> is true if softtimeout was enabled and not all documents could be matched and ranked
      with the first phase ranking function within the timeout</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the degraded reasons are not mutually exclusive.
In the example, the softtimeout was triggered
and only 99% of the documents where queried before the time budget was used.
One could imagine scenarios where 10 out of 11 nodes involved in the query execution were healthy
and triggered soft timeout and delivered a result,
while the last node was in a bad state (e.g. hw issues) and could not produce a result at all,
and that would cause both <em>timeout</em> and <em>adaptive-timeout</em> to be true.
</p><p>
When working on Results in a <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher</a>,
get the coverage information programmatically:
</p>
<pre>
    @Override
    public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
        Result result = execution.search(query);
        Coverage  coverage = result.getCoverage(false);
        if (coverage != null &amp;&amp; coverage.isDegraded()) {
            logger.warning("Got a degraded result for query " + query + " : " + coverage.getResultPercentage() + "% was searched");
        }
        return result;
    }
</pre>



<h2 id="match-phase-degradation">Match phase degradation</h2>
<p>
Refer to the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match-phase">match-phase reference</a>.
Match-phase works by specifying an <code>attribute</code> that measures document
quality in some way (popularity, click-through rate, pagerank, bid value, price, text quality).
In addition, a <code>max-hits</code> value is specified
that specifies how many hits are "more than enough" for the application.
Then an estimate is made after collecting a reasonable amount of hits for the query,
and if the estimate is higher than the configured <code>max-hits</code> value,
an extra limitation is added to the query,
ensuring that only the highest quality documents can become hits.
</p><p>
In effect, this limits the documents actually queried to the highest quality documents,
a subset of the full corpus,
where the size of subset is calculated in such a way
that the query is estimated to give <code>max-hits</code> hits.
Since some (low-quality) hits will already have been collected to do the estimation,
the actual number of hits returned will usually be higher than max-hits.
But since the distribution of documents isn't perfectly smooth,
you risk sometimes getting less than the configured <code>max-hits</code> hits back.
</p><p>
Note that limiting hits in the match-phase also affects <a href="grouping.html">aggregation/grouping</a>,
and total-hit-count since it actually limits, so the query gets fewer hits.
Also note that it doesn't really make sense to use this
feature together with a <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">WAND operator</a> that also limit hits,
since they both operate in the same manner,
and you would get interference between them that could cause unpredictable results.
The graph shows possible hits versus actual hits in a corpus with 100 000 documents,
where <code>max-hits</code> is configured to 10 000.
The corpus is a synthetic (slightly randomized) data set,
in practice the graph will be less smooth:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/relevance/match-phase-max-hits.png" alt="Plot of possible vs. actual hits" />
<p>
There is a content node metric per rank-profile named
<em>content.proton.documentdb.matching.rank_profile.limited_queries</em>
which can be used to see how many of the queries are actually affected by these settings;
compare with the corresponding <em>content.proton.documentdb.matching.rank_profile.queries</em> metric
to measure the percentage.
<p>


<h3>Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>
There are some important things to consider before using match-phase.
In a normal query scenario, latency is directly proportional to the number of hits the query matches:
a query that matches few documents will have low latency
and a query that matches many documents will have high latency.
Match-phase has the <strong>opposite</strong> effect.
This means that if you have queries that match few documents,
match-phase might make these queries significantly slower.
It might actually be faster to run the query without the filter.
</p><p>
Example: Lets say you have a corpus with a document attribute named <em>created_time</em>.
For all queries you want the newest content surfaced, so you enable match-phase on <em>created_time</em>.
So far, so good - you get a great latency and always get your top-k hits.
The problem might come if you introduce a filter.
If you have a filter saying you only want documents from the last day,
then match-phase can become sub-optimal and in some cases much worse than running without match-phase.
</p>
<p>
By design, Vespa will evaluate potential matches for a query by the order of their internal documentid.
This means it will start evaluating documents in the order they were indexed on the node,
and for most use-cases that means the oldest documents first.
Without a filter, every document is a potential match,
and match-phase will quickly figure out how it can optimize.
With the filter, on the other hand, the algorithm need to evaluate almost the full corpus
before it reaches potential matches (1 day old corpus),
and because of the way the algorithm is implemented,
end up with doing a lot of unnecessary work and can have orders of magnitude higher latencies
than running the query without the filter.
</p><p>
Another important thing to mention is that the reported total-hits will be different
when doing queries with match-phase enabled.
This is because match-phase works on an estimated "virtual" corpus,
which might have much fewer hits than is actually in the full corpus.
</p><p>
If used correctly match-phase can be a life-saver, however,
it is not a straight forward fix-it-all silver bullet.
Please test and measure your use of match-phase,
and contact the Vespa team if your results are not what you expect.
