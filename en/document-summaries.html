<p>
  Use document summaries to configure which fields to include in results.
  The <em>default</em> summary contains <em>all</em> fields that
  are possible to include in summaries; all other summaries will contain
  a subset of the fields included in the <em>default</em> summary.
</p>
<p>
  The default summary class will always access the document store because it
  includes the <a href="documents.html#document-ids">document ID</a> which is stored here.
  To include the <em>document ID</em> in a custom summary
  class, add a field for the id and include it in the summary class.
</p>
<p>
  Use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary">dynamic</a>
  to generate dynamic abstracts of fields, based on search keywords.
</p>



<h2 id="defining-summary-sets-in-the-schema">Defining summary sets in the schema</h2>
<p>
  Define additional summary sets as described in
  the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary">schema reference</a>.
<p>
  Example: the <em>title</em> and <em>year</em> fields are included in a the <em>titleyear</em> summary.
</p>
<pre>
schema music {

    document music {
        field title type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
        field artist type string {
            indexing: summary | attribute | index
        }
        field year type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }
        field popularity type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }
        field url type uri {
            indexing: summary | index
        }
    }

    document-summary titleyear {
        summary title type string {
            source: title
        }
        summary year type int {
            source: year
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h2 id="using-summaries-in-queries">Using summaries in queries</h2>
<p>
  Use <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#presentation.summary">presentation.summary=[summary name]</a>
  in queries to select summary class (the default class is called <em>default</em>).
  See <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#presentation.summary">Query API</a>. Example:
</p>
<pre>
/search/?yql=select+*+from+sources+*+where+default+contains+"best"&amp;presentation.summary=titleyear
</pre>
<!-- ToDo: replace with a live query without the urlencoding -->
<p>
  The <em>select</em> statement in YQL lists a set of fields to return.
  Vespa in general makes a best-effort to return those fields, and only those fields,
  unless a wildcard ("*") is given as argument.
  The wildcard implies returning the full set of fields included in the given summary class.
</p>
<p>
  In conjunction with YQL statements, the <em>summary</em> argument operates like a
  definition of the set which YQL <em>select</em> then chooses a subset of fields from.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, if the YQL expression is "select * â€¦", and the summary
  argument is <em>titleyear</em>, all the fields in the summary class <em>titleyear</em> will be
  returned. If the select statement lists one or more fields (and summary is
  <em>titleyear</em>), the summary class <em>titleyear</em> is fetched, and the fields
  <em>not</em> listed in the select statement will be stripped away.
</p>



<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>
  When using additional summary classes to increase performance,
  only the network data size is changed - the data read from storage is unchanged.
  Having "debug" fields with summary enabled will hence also affect the
  amount of information that needs to be read from disk.
</p>
<p>
  Vespa keeps <a href="attributes.html">attribute</a>
  type fields in memory and fetches those fields from
  memory when requested as part of document summaries.
  This means summaries are memory-only operations if all fields are attributes.
  The other document fields are stored as blobs/records in the
  <a href="proton.html#document-store">document store</a>.
  This record is used when processing summary requests
  that include fields in this record, and as needed during visiting or
  re-distribution of content to handle elasticity.
</p>
<p>
  See <a href="query-api.html#query-execution">query execution</a> -
  breakdown of the summary (a.k.a. result processing, rendering) phase:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The document summary latency on the content node,
    tracked by <a href="operations/metrics.html">content_proton_search_protocol_docsum_latency_average</a>.</li>
  <li>Getting data across from content nodes to containers.</li>
  <li>Deserialization from internal binary formats (potentially) to Java objects
    if touched in a <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher</a>,
    and finally serialization to JSON (default rendering) + rendering and network.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The work, and thus latency increases with more <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#hits">hits</a>.
