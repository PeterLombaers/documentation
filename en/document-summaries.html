<p>
Use document summaries to configure which fields to include in results.
The <em>default</em> summary contains <em>all</em> fields that
are possible to include in summaries; all other summaries will contain
a subset of the fields included in the <em>default</em> summary.
</p><p>
Vespa keeps <a href="attributes.html">attribute</a>
type fields in memory and fetches those fields from
memory when requested as part of document summaries.
This means summaries are memory-only operations if all fields are attributes.
The other document fields are stored as blobs/records in the
<a href="proton.html#document-store">document store</a>.
This record is used when processing summary requests
that include fields in this record, and as needed during visiting or
re-distribution of content to handle elasticity.
</p><p>
The default summary class will always access the document store because it
includes the <a href="documents.html#document-ids">document ID</a> which is stored here.
To include the <a href="documents.html#document-ids">document ID</a> in a custom summary
class, add a field for the id and include it in the summary class.
</p><p>
When using additional summary classes to increase performance,
only the network data size is changed - the data read from storage is unchanged.
Having "debug" fields with summary enabled will hence also affect the
amount of information that needs to be read from disk.
</p><p>
Use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary">dynamic</a>
to generate dynamic abstracts of fields, based on search keywords.

<h2 id="defining-summary-sets-in-the-schema">Defining summary sets in the schema</h2>
<p>
Define additional summary sets as described in
the <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary">schema reference</a>.
<p>
Example: the <em>title</em> and <em>year</em> fields are
included in a the <em>titleyear</em> summary.
</p>
<pre class="brush: sd">
# A basic schema - called music, should be saved to music.sd
schema music {

  # It contains one document type only - called music as well
  document music {

    field title type string {
      indexing: summary | index   
    }

    field artist type string {
      indexing: summary | attribute | index
    }

    field year type int {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }

    field popularity type int {
      indexing: summary | attribute
    }

    field url type uri {
      indexing: summary | index
    }

   }
   document-summary titleyear {
    summary title type string {
      source: title
    }

    summary year type int {
      source: year
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<h2 id="summary-classes-in-queries">Using summaries in queries</h2>
<p>
  Use <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#presentation.summary"><em>presentation.summary=[summary name]</em></a>
  in queries to select summary class (the default class is called <em>default</em>).
  See <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#presentation.summary">Query API</a>. Example:
</p>
<pre>
/search/?yql=select+*+from+sources+*+where+default+contains+"best"&amp;presentation.summary=titleyear
</pre>
<p>
  The <em>select</em> statement in YQL lists a set of fields to return.
  Vespa in general makes a best-effort to return those fields, and only those fields,
  unless a wildcard ("*") is given as argument.
  The wildcard implies returning the full set of fields included in the given summary class.
</p>
<p>
  In conjunction with YQL statements, the <em>summary</em> argument operates like a
  definition of the set which YQL <em>select</em> then chooses a subset of fields from.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, if the YQL expression is "select * â€¦", and the summary
  argument is <em>titleyear</em>, all the fields in the summary class <em>titleyear</em> will be
  returned. If the select statement lists one or more fields (and summary is
  <em>titleyear</em>), the summary class <em>titleyear</em> is fetched, and the fields
  <em>not</em> listed in the select statement will be stripped away.
</p>
