<p><i>Ranking</i> is where Vespa does computing, or <i>inference</i> over documents.
The computations to be done are expressed in functions called
<a href="ranking-expressions-features.html">ranking expressions</a>,
bundled into <a href="#rank-profiles">rank profiles</a> defined in <a href="schemas.html">schemas</a>.
These can range from simple math expressions combining some <a href="reference/rank-features.html">rank features</a>,
to <a href="tensor-examples.html">tensor expressions</a> or large machine-learned <a href="onnx.html">Onnx models</a>.



<h2 id="two-phase-ranking">Two-phase ranking</h2>

<p>Rank profiles can define two <i>phases</i> that are evaluated locally on content nodes, which means that
no data needs to be transferred to container nodes to make inferences over data:</p>

<pre>
schema myapp {

    rank-profile my-rank-profile {

        num-threads-per-search:4

        first-phase {
            expression {
                attribute(quality) * freshness(timestamp)
            }
        }

        second-phase {
            expression: sum(onnx(my_onnx_model))
            rerank-count: 50
        }

    }
}
</pre>

<p>The first phase is executed for all matching documents while the second is executed for the
best rerank-count documents per content node according to the first-phase function. This
is useful to direct more computation towards the most promising candidate documents, see
<a href="phased-ranking.html">phased ranking</a>.</p>

<h2 id="global-phase-ranking">Global-phase ranking</h2>
<p>It's also possible to define an additional phase that runs on the
stateless container nodes after merging hits from the content nodes.
This can be more efficient use of CPU (especially with many content nodes)
and can be used instead of second-phase, or in addition to a moderately
expensive second-phase.</p>

<pre>
schema myapp {

    rank-profile my-rank-profile {

        num-threads-per-search:4

        first-phase {
            expression {
                attribute(quality) * freshness(timestamp)
            }
        }

        second-phase {
            expression {
                my_combination_of(fieldMatch(title), bm25(abstract), attribute(quality), freshness(timestamp))
            }
        }

        global-phase {
            expression: sum(onnx(my_onnx_model))
            rerank-count: 100
        }

    }
}
</pre>

In contrast to the first-phase and second-phase ranking, the global-phase expression needs
its input data transferred from content nodes to the container; for the example above
this means that any inputs used by <em>my_onnx_model</em> would be automatically added
as match-features so the ONNX model can get the per-hit data it needs.

<h2 id="machine-learned-model-inference">Machine-Learned model inference</h2>

<p>Vespa supports ML models in these formats:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="onnx.html">ONNX</a></li>
    <li><a href="xgboost.html">XGBoost</a></li>
    <li><a href="lightgbm.html">LightGBM</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As these are exposed as rank features, it is possible to rank using a <em>model ensemble</em>.
Deploy multiple model instances and write a ranking expression that combines the results:</p>

<pre>
schema myapp {

    onnx-model my_model_1 {
        ...
    }
    onnx-model my_model_2 {
        ...
    }

    rank-profile my-rank-profile {
    ...
        second-phase {
            expression: max( sum(onnx(my_model_1), sum(onnx(my_model_2) )
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<!-- ToDo: Not exclusive list, we can represent lots of model, logistic regression etc. Also mention PyTorch through ONNX. -->


<h2 id="model-training-and-deployment">Model Training and Deployment</h2>

<p>Models are deployed in <a href="application-packages.html">application packages</a>.
Read more on how to automate training, deployment and re-training in a closed loop using
<a href="https://cloud.vespa.ai/">Vespa Cloud</a>.</p>



<h2 id="rank-profiles">Rank profiles</h2>

<p>Ranking expressions are defined in <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">rank profiles</a> -
either inside the schema or equivalently in their own files in the
<a href="reference/application-packages-reference.html">application package</a>, named
<code>schemas/[schema-name]/[profile-name].profile</code>.</p>

<p>One schema can have any number of rank profiles for implementing e.g. different use cases
or <a href="testing.html#feature-switches-and-bucket-tests">bucket testing</a> variations.
If no profile is specified, the <a href="text-matching-ranking.html#ranking">default text ranking</a>
profile is used.</p>

<p>Rank profiles can <em>inherit</em> other profiles. This makes it possible to define complex profiles and variants
without duplication.</p>

<p>Queries select a rank profile using the
<a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#ranking.profile">ranking.profile</a> argument
in requests or a <a href="query-profiles.html">query profiles</a>,
or equivalently in <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher</a> code, by</p>

<pre>
query.getRanking().setProfile("my-rank-profile");
</pre>

<p>If no profile is specified in the query, the one called <code>default</code> is used.
This profile is available also if not defined explicitly.</p>

<p>Another special rank profile called <code>unranked</code> is also always available.
Specifying this boosts performance in queries which do not need ranking because random order is fine or
<a href="reference/sorting.html">explicit sorting</a> is used.</p>


<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>Rank profiles are <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> evaluated lazily. Example:</p>
<pre>
function inline foo(tensor, defaultVal) {
    expression: if (count(tensor) == 0, defaultValue, sum(tensor))
}

function bar() {
    expression: foo(tensor, sum(tensor1 * tensor2))
}
</pre>
<p>
  <em>Will the <code>sum</code> in the <code>bar</code> function be computed lazily,
    meaning only if <code>tensor</code> is empty?</em>
</p>
<p>
  No, this would require lambda arguments.
  Only doubles and tensors are passed between functions.
</p>
