<h2 id="matching">Matching</h2>

<p>Text search is normally best run using a string field in <em>index</em> mode:</p>

<pre>
field album type string {
    indexing: summary | index
}
</pre>

<p>Below, find details on transformations to the text for text indexing and search.
Use inspection tools to dump data from a content node,
and query tracing to understand matching details.</p>

<p>The <em>album</em> field has <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#indexing">index</a> mode.
For text fields, this enables the transformations below, and increases query recall.
Use the <a href="vespa-quick-start.html">quick start</a> guide and stop after the feeding step.
Make sure to feed all 5 albums with titles:</p>

<pre>
$ cat sample-apps/album-recommendation/src/test/resources/*.json | grep album
        "album": "A Head Full of Dreams",
        "album": "Hardwired...To Self-Destruct",
        "album": "Liebe ist für alle da",
        "album": "Love Is Here To Stay",
        "album": "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?",
</pre>

<p>Flush and dump index data (file name can change for subsequent flushes):</p>

<pre>
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-proton-cmd --local triggerFlush &amp;&amp; \
    /opt/vespa/bin/<a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-index-inspect">vespa-index-inspect</a> dumpwords \
    --indexdir /opt/vespa/var/db/vespa/search/cluster.music/n0/documents/music/0.ready/index/index.flush.1 \
    --field album'

</pre>
<p>Observe the <a href="linguistics.html">linguistic transformations</a> to the data before indexed:</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Transformation</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Hardwired...To &#x2192; Hardwired To</td><td>Tokenization - split terms on non-characters</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td>Head &#x2192; head</td><td>Lowercasing</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td>für &#x2192; fur</td><td>Normalizing</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td>dreams &#x2192; dream</td><td>Stemming</td>
</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
Then, change from <em>index</em> to <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#indexing">attribute</a>
in <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/album-recommendation/schemas/music.sd">
src/main/application/schemas/music.sd</a>:
</p>
<pre>
    field album type string {
-       indexing: summary | index
+       indexing: summary | attribute
    }
</pre>
<p>
Run the tutorial again using the new schema, this time dumping data from the attributes
(snapshot name can change with flushes):
</p>
<pre>
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-proton-cmd --local triggerFlush &amp;&amp; \
  /opt/vespa/bin/<a href="reference/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-attribute-inspect">vespa-attribute-inspect</a> -p \
  /opt/vespa/var/db/vespa/search/cluster.music/n0/documents/music/0.ready/attribute/album/snapshot-10/album &amp;&amp; \
  cat /opt/vespa/var/db/vespa/search/cluster.music/n0/documents/music/0.ready/attribute/album/snapshot-10/album.out'

</pre>
<p>
The most important observation is that the strings are added <em>as-is</em> to attributes.
Hence, values are matched in full, including whitespace.
When searching attributes, both query terms and attribute data are lowercased before matching.
Read more about the attribute <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match">word match mode</a>.
</p>


<!-- ToDo: Add more match examples for indexed search-->


<h3 id="query-trace">Query Trace</h3>
<p>
Adding <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#trace.level">trace.level=2</a>
gives insight when testing queries - example attribute lowercasing:
</p>
<pre>
http://localhost:8080/search/?ranking=rank_albums&yql=select%20%2A%20from%20sources%20%2A%20where%20album%20contains%20%22Liebe+ist+f%C3%BCr+alle+da%22&trace.level=2

http://localhost:8080/search/?ranking=rank_albums&yql=select%20%2A%20from%20sources%20%2A%20where%20album%20contains%20%22liebe+ist+f%C3%BCr+alle+da%22&trace.level=2
</pre>
<p>
Also try query tracing to see how query parsing changes with
<em>index</em> and <em>attribute</em> indexing modes.
</p>


<h3 id="prefix-match">Prefix Match</h3>
<p>
    A prefix search will match the query term "hea" to documents with the term "head" in a <code>string</code> field
    with <code>indexing: attribute</code>. Note that it is requires that the field matching is
    specified with the annotation <code>{prefix: true}</code> to enable prefix matching.
</p><p>
    E.g. <code>... contains ([{prefix:true}]"hea")</code>
</p><p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/incremental-search/search-suggestions">
  search-suggestions</a> sample application uses prefix search, see README for a design discussion.
</p>
<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th style="white-space: nowrap">Array of string attributes</th>
    <td>
      Use an attribute with array of strings in addition to the index string field.
      The array to support more terms - if only one term in the field, the array is not needed.
      The application must split the text into terms and add these to the array.
      This can be a viable approach for fields with few terms and semi-structured input - example:
<pre>
schema company {
    document company {
        field company_name_string type string {
            indexing: summary
        }
    }
    field company_name_array type array&lt;string&gt; {
        indexing: input company_name_string | trim | split " +" | attribute
    }
}
</pre>
      Adding "Goldman" and "Sachs" will match query terms like "Gold" and "Sach".
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3 id="N-Gram-match">N-Gram Match</h3>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
    <th>N-Gram indexing</th>
    <td>
      This is most often used in languages that are not tokenized (example: many Asian languages).
      Example - this will index "A Head Full of Dreams" to:
<pre>
field album type string {
    indexing: summary | index
    match {
        gram
        gram-size: 3
    }
}

a	1
ams	1
dre	1
ead	1
eam	1
ful	1
hea	1
of	1
rea	1
ull	1
</pre>
      This will enable matching of any 3-term substring.
      This is generally not useful for text searching,
      other than possibly for an extra field with these ngrams for increased recall.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3 id="regexp-match">Regular expression Match</h3>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
    <th>Regular expressions</th>
    <td>
      Using <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#matches">regular expressions</a>
      is supported in attributes.
      There are however no optimizing data structures for query speed,
      it runs the expression over all attribute values.

<h2 id="ranking">Ranking</h2>

<p>The default ranking is the first-phase function <code>nativeRank</code>, that is a function returning the value of
the <a href="nativerank.html">nativeRank rank feature</a>, and no second-phase.</p>

<p>An good simple alternative to <code>nativeRank</code> for text ranking is using the
<a href="reference/bm25.html">BM25</a> rank feature.</p>

<p>If the expression is written manually, it might be most convenient to
stick with using the <code>fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</code> feature for each field.
This feature combines the more basic fieldMatch features in a reasonable way.
A good way to combine the fieldMatch score of each field is to use a weighted average as explained above.
Another way is to combine the field match scores
using the <code>fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weight/significance/importance</code> features
which takes term weight or rareness or both into account
and allows a normalized score to be produced by simply summing the product of this feature
and any other normalized per-field score for each field.
In addition, some attribute value(s) must usually be included
to determine the a priori quality of each document.
</p><p>
For example, assuming the title field is more important than the body field,
create a ranking expression which gives more weight to that field, as in the example above.
Vespa contains some built-in convenience support for this -
weights can be set in the individual fields by <code>weight: &lt;number&gt;</code>
and the feature <code>match</code> can be used to get a weighted average
of the fieldMatch scores of each field.
The overall ranking expression might contain other ranking dimensions than just text match,
like freshness, the quality of the document, or any other property of the document or query.
</p>


<h3 id="weight-significance-and-connectedness">Weight, significance and connectedness</h3>
<p>
Modify the values of the match features from the query
by sending weight, significance and connectedness with the query:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead></thead><tbody>
    <tr><th>Weight</th><td><p>
      Set query term <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#weight">weight</a>.
      Example: <code>... where (title contains ({weight:200}"heads") AND title contains "tails")</code>
      specifies that <code>heads</code> is twice as important for the final rank score than <code>tails</code>
      (the default weight is 100).
      </p><p>
      Weight is used in <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).weight">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weight</a></code>, which can be multiplied with
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name)">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</a></code> to yield a weighted score for the field,
      and in <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).weightedOccurrence">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).weightedOccurrence</a></code>
      to get an occurrence score which is higher if higher weighted terms occurs most.
      Configure static field weights in the
      <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#weight">schema</a>.</p></td>
    </tr><tr><th>Significance</th><td><p>
      Set query term <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#significance">significance</a> -
      how rare a particular term is in the corpus or the language.
      This is sometimes valuable information because if a document matches a rare word,
      it might mean the document is more important than one which matches a common word.
      Significance is calculated automatically by Vespa during indexing,
      but can also be overridden by setting the significance values on the query terms
      in a <a href="searcher-development.html">Searcher component</a>.
      Significance is accessible in
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).significance">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).significance</a></code>, which can be used the same way as weight.
      Weight and significance are also averaged into
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).importance">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).importance</a></code> for convenience.</p></td>
    </tr><tr><th>Connectedness</th><td><p>
      Signify the degree of connection between adjacent terms in the query -
      set query term <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#connectivity">connectivity</a> to another term.
      For example, the query <code>new york newspaper</code> should have a higher connectedness
      between the terms "new" and "york" than between "york" and "newspaper" to rank documents higher
      if they contain "new york" as a phrase.
      Term connectedness is taken into account by
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name).proximity">
      fieldMatch(<em>name</em>).proximity</a></code>,
      which is also an important contribution to
      <code><a href="reference/rank-features.html#fieldMatch(name)">fieldMatch(<em>name</em>)</a></code>.
      Connectedness is a normalized value which is 0.1 by default.
      It must be set by a custom Searcher,
      looking up connectivity information from somewhere - there is no query syntax for it.</p></td>
      <!-- ToDo: Use connectivity and id query annotations to do this? -->
