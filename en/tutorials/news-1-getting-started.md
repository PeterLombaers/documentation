Our goal with this series is to set up a Vespa application for personalized
news recommendations. We will do this in stages, starting with a simple news
search system and gradually adding functionality as we go through the
tutorial parts.

The parts are:  

1. [Getting started](news-1-getting-started.html) - this part
2. [A basic news search application](news-2-basic-feeding-and-query.html) - application packages, feeding, query
3. [News search](news-3-searching.html) - sorting, grouping, and ranking
4. [Generating embeddings for users and news articles](news-4-embeddings.html)
5. [News recommendation](news-5-recommendation.html) - partial updates (news embeddings), ANNs, filtering
6. [News recommendation with searchers](news-6-recommendation-with-searchers.html) - custom searchers, doc processors
7. [News recommendation with parent-child](news-7-recommendation-with-parent-child.html) - parent-child, tensor ranking
8. Advanced news recommendation - intermission - training a ranking model
9. Advanced news recommendation - ML models

There are different entry points to this tutorial. This one is for getting
started using Docker on your local machine. Getting started on 
[cloud.vespa.ai](https://cloud.vespa.ai) is coming soon. We will also have a
version for [pyvespa](https://github.com/vespa-engine/pyvespa) soon.
For atomic model updates, see the [Models hot swap](models-hot-swap.html) tutorial.

In this part we will start with a minimal Vespa application to
get used to some basic operations for running the application on Docker.
In the next part of the tutorial, we'll start developing our application.



## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install) 
  or Docker on Linux
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - or download the
  [sample apps](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/archive/master.zip)
- python 3
- Operating system: macOS or Linux
- Architecture: x86_64
- Minimum **10 GB** memory dedicated to Docker (the default is 2 GB on Macs)

In upcoming parts of this series, we will have some additional python dependencies -
we use PyTorch to train vector representations for news and users
and train machine learning models for use in ranking.



## A minimal Vespa application

This tutorial has a [companion sample application](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps.git)
found under the `news` directory. Throughout the tutorial we will be
using support code from this application. Also, the final state of 
each tutorial can be found in the various `app-...` sub-directories.

Let's start by cloning the sample application:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec">
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps.git
$ cd sample-apps/news
</pre>
</div>

The `app-1-getting-started` directory contains a minimal Vespa application.
There are three files there:

- `services.xml` -  defines the services the application consists of
- `hosts.xml` - defines which hosts or nodes the application will run on
- `schemas/news.sd` - defines the schema for searchable content. 

We will get back to these files in the next part of the tutorial.



## Starting Vespa

This application doesn't contain much at the moment, but let's start up the
application anyway by starting a Docker container to run it:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec">
$ docker pull vespaengine/vespa
$ docker run -m 10G --detach --name vespa --hostname vespa-tutorial \
  --publish 8080:8080 --publish 19071:19071 --publish 19092:19092 \
  vespaengine/vespa
</pre>
</div>

First, we pull the latest Vespa-image from the Docker repository, then we
start it with the name `vespa`. This starts the Docker container and the
initial Vespa services to be able to deploy an application.

Starting the container can take a short while. Before continuing, make sure
that the configuration service is running. This is signified by a `200 OK`
response when querying the configuration service, running on port 19071:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-wait-for="200 OK">
$ curl -s --head http://localhost:19071/ApplicationStatus
</pre>
</div>

With the config server up and running, deploy the application:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-assert-contains="prepared and activated.">
$ (cd app-1-getting-started && zip -r - .) | \
  curl --header Content-Type:application/zip --data-binary @- \
  localhost:19071/application/v2/tenant/default/prepareandactivate
</pre>
</div>

The command uploads the application and verifies the content.
If anything is wrong with the application, this step will fail with a failure description,
otherwise this switches the application to a live status.

Whenever you have a new version of your application, 
run the same command to deploy the application.
In most cases, there is no need to restart the application.
Vespa takes care of reconfiguring the system.
If a restart is required in some rare case, however, the output will notify you.

In the upcoming parts of the tutorials, we'll frequently deploy the 
application in this manner. 

{% include note.html content="We prepare the application <em>directory</em>.
Both application directories and a zip file containing the application are accepted.
A zip file is created when compiling and packaging an application containing custom Java code.
We'll get back to that in part 6 of the tutorial."%}


The first time you deploy your application, it might take a while to
start the services. Like the configuration server, you can query the 
status:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-wait-for="200 OK">
$ curl -s --head http://localhost:8080/ApplicationStatus
</pre>
</div>

This returns a `200 OK` when it is ready for receiving traffic. Note here 
that we don't run the command inside the Docker container. The port `8080`
was exposed when starting the Docker container, so we can query it directly.



## Feeding to Vespa

We must index data before we can search for it. This is called 'feeding', and
we'll get back to that in more detail in the next part of the tutorial. For
now, to test that everything is up and running, we'll feed in a single test
document. We'll use the `vespa-feed-client` Java feeder for this:

<!-- ToDo: Replace with vespa-feed-client -->
<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec">
$ curl -L -o vespa-feed-client-cli.zip \
    https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/yahoo/vespa/vespa-feed-client-cli/7.527.20/vespa-feed-client-cli-7.527.20-zip.zip
$ unzip vespa-feed-client-cli.zip
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec" >
$ ./vespa-feed-client-cli/vespa-feed-client \
  --verbose --file doc.json --endpoint http://localhost:8080
</pre>
</div>

This runs the `vespa-feed-client` Java client with the file `doc.json` file.
This contains a single document which we'll query for below.



## Testing Vespa

If everything is ok so far, our application should be up and running.
We can query the endpoint:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-assert-contains='Hello world!'>
$ curl -s "http://localhost:8080/search/?yql=select+*+from+sources+*+where+sddocname+contains+%22news%22"
</pre>
</div>

This uses the `search` API to search for all documents of type `news`.
This should return `1` result, which is the document we fed above.

Remove the document:
<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="exec" data-test-assert-contains='id:news:news::1'>
$ curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/document/v1/news/news/docid/1"
</pre>
</div>

Well done!



## Stopping and starting Vespa

Keep Vespa running to continue with next steps in this tutorial set (skip the below).

To stop Vespa, we can run the following commands:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre>
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-stop-services'
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-stop-configserver'
</pre>
</div>

Likewise, to start the Vespa services:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre>
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-start-configserver'
$ docker exec vespa bash -c '/opt/vespa/bin/vespa-start-services'
</pre>
</div>

If a restart is required due to changes in the application package,
these two steps are what you need to do.

To wipe the index and restart:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre>
$ docker exec vespa bash -c ' \
  /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-stop-services && \
  /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-remove-index -force && \
  /opt/vespa/bin/vespa-start-services'
</pre>
</div>

You can stop and kill the Vespa Docker application like this:

<div class="pre-parent">
  <button class="d-icon d-duplicate pre-copy-button" onclick="copyPreContent(this)"></button>
<pre data-test="after">
$ docker rm -f vespa
</pre>
</div>

This will delete the Vespa application, including all data, so don't do this unless you are sure.



## Conclusion

Our simple application should now be up and running. In the [next part
of the tutorial](news-2-basic-feeding-and-query.html), we'll start building
from this foundation.
