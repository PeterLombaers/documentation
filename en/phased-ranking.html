<p>
  Ranking, in general, becomes more accurate by using complex expressions which use many features.
</p><p>
  Read the <a href="query-api.html">query API</a> guide
  to get an overview of how queries are executed in Vespa, before continuing this guide.
</p><p>
  Vespa supports multiple rank phases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Re-ranking of the top hits from the content nodes
      using a custom <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>. See concrete example
      in <a href="reranking-in-searcher.html">reranking in searcher</a>.
      </li>
  <li>Re-ranking at each content node using two phase ranking configured by rank profiles
      with ranking expressions working on scalars, tensors or matching features</li>
  <li>Retrieval and Ranking with query operators like <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">WAND/Weak And</a>
      which speeds up retrieval of top matches of a disjunction query (OR) or
      <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">Nearest Neighbor Search</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stateless-re-ranking">Stateless re-ranking</h2>
<p>
  It's possible to write <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>
  which can re-rank hits using any custom scoring function or model.
  The searcher can also blend and re-order hits from multiple sources
  when using <a href="federation.html">federation</a> of content sources.
  See <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/msmarco-ranking/src/main/java/ai/vespa/examples/searcher/ReRankingSearcher.java">
  ReRankingSearcher</a> for inspiration.
  The linked searcher re-ranks the top global results from all content nodes using a Transformer (BERT) model.
</p><p>
  The searcher might request rank features calculated by the content nodes to be returned
  along with the hit fields using <a href="reference/inspecting-structured-data.html">summary-features</a>.
  The features returned can be configured in the <em>rank-profile</em>
  as <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
</p><p>
  The number of <em>hits</em> is limited by the query api
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#hits">hits</a> parameter and
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#queryProfile">maxHits</a> setting.
  The hits available for container level re-ranking are the global top ranking hits
  after content nodes have retrieved and ranked the hits
  and global top ranking hits have been found by merging the responses from the content nodes.
</p>



<h2 id="two-phase-ranking-content-nodes">Two-phase ranking content nodes</h2>
<p>
  Rank expressions are configured in the <code>rank-profile</code> section of
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">schema</a>.
  The rank-profile supports having two phases of ranking; first-phase and second-phase:
<p>
  By default, second-phase ranking (if specified) is run on the 100 best hits
  from the first-phase ranking per content node,
  after matching and before information is returned to the container.
  The number of hits to rerank can be configured as well in the rank-profile. Example:
</p>
<pre>
schema myapp {
    &hellip;
    rank-profile title-freshness inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression {
                nativeRank(title) + freshness(timestamp)
            }
        }
        second-phase {
            expression {
                xgboost("my-model.json")
            }
            rerank-count: 50
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, the first phase uses the text matching feature
  <a href="reference/nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> scoped to the <em>title</em> field
  plus one of the built-in document <a href="reference/rank-features.html">ranking features</a>
  named <em>freshness</em> over a <em>timestamp</em> field which stores the epoch time in second resolution.
  For each content node, the top 50 hits from the first phase function is re-ranked using
  a trained <a href="xgboost.html">xgboost</a> model.
</p>



<h2 id="top-k-query-operators">Top-K Query Operators</h2>
<p>
  If the first-phase ranking function can be approximated as a simple linear function,
  and the query mode is <em>any</em>,
  the <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">Weak And/WAND</a> implementations in Vespa
  allows avoiding fully evaluating all the documents matching the query with the <em>first-phase</em> function.
  Instead, only the top K hits using the internal operator ranking will be exposed
  to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
</p><p>
  Both wand implementations accepts a targeted number of hits (top N).
  Each content node will expose all hits that were evaluated to the first-phase ranking function,
  while skipped documents will not.
  The skipped set are the ones that matches the query,
  but which cannot outperform any of the already collected hits on the internal scoring heap.
  Due to not fully evaluating all documents matching the query,
  the total hit count becomes inaccurate when using weakAnd/Wand.
</p><p>
  The <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> operator is also a top k retrieval operator which does ranking (by distance) and retrieval
  in one process and exposes only a small subset of the matching documents to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
</p>



<h2 id="choosing-phased-ranking-functions">Choosing phased ranking functions</h2>
<p>
A good ranking expression will for most applications consume too much CPU
to be runnable on the entire result set within the latency budget/SLA.
The application ranking function should hence in most cases be a second phase function.
The task then becomes to find a first phase function,
which correlates sufficiently well with the second phase function -
this to ensure that relevance is not hurt too much
by not evaluating the real ranking function on all the hits.
