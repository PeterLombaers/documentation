<p>
  Ranking, in general, becomes more accurate by using complex expressions which use many features.
</p><p>
  Read the <a href="query-api.html">query API</a> guide
  to get an overview of how queries are executed in Vespa, before continuing this guide.
</p><p>
  Vespa supports multiple rank phases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Re-ranking of the top hits from the content nodes
      using a custom <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>. See concrete example
      in <a href="reranking-in-searcher.html">reranking in searcher</a>.
      </li>
  <li>Re-ranking at each content node using two phase ranking configured by rank profiles
      with ranking expressions working on scalars, tensors or matching features</li>
  <li>Retrieval and Ranking with query operators like <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">WAND/Weak And</a>
      which speeds up retrieval of top matches of a disjunction query (OR) or
      <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">Nearest Neighbor Search</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stateless-re-ranking">Stateless re-ranking</h2>
<p>
  It's possible to write <a href="searcher-development.html">stateless searchers</a>
  which can re-rank hits using any custom scoring function or model.
  The searcher can also blend and re-order hits from multiple sources
  when using <a href="federation.html">federation</a> of content sources.
  See <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/msmarco-ranking/src/main/java/ai/vespa/examples/searcher/ReRankingSearcher.java">
  ReRankingSearcher</a> for inspiration.
  The linked searcher re-ranks the top global results from all content nodes using a Transformer (BERT) model.
</p><p>
  The searcher might request rank features calculated by the content nodes to be returned
  along with the hit fields using <a href="reference/inspecting-structured-data.html">summary-features</a>.
  The features returned can be configured in the <em>rank-profile</em>
  as <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
</p><p>
  The number of <em>hits</em> is limited by the query api
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#hits">hits</a> parameter and
  <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#queryProfile">maxHits</a> setting.
  The hits available for container level re-ranking are the global top ranking hits
  after content nodes have retrieved and ranked the hits
  and global top ranking hits have been found by merging the responses from the content nodes.
</p>



<h2 id="two-phase-ranking-content-nodes">Two-phase ranking content nodes</h2>
<p>
  Rank expressions are configured in the <code>rank-profile</code> section of
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#rank-profile">schema</a>.
  The rank-profile supports having two phases of ranking; first-phase and second-phase:
<p>
  By default, second-phase ranking (if specified) is run on the 100 best hits
  from the first-phase ranking per content node,
  after matching and before information is returned to the container.
  The number of hits to rerank can be configured as well in the rank-profile. Example:
</p>
<pre>
schema myapp {
    &hellip;
    rank-profile title-freshness inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression {
                nativeRank(title) + freshness(timestamp)
            }
        }
        second-phase {
            expression {
                xgboost("my-model.json")
            }
            rerank-count: 50
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  In this example, the first phase uses the text matching feature
  <a href="reference/nativerank.html">nativeRank</a> scoped to the <em>title</em> field
  plus one of the built-in document <a href="reference/rank-features.html">ranking features</a>
  named <em>freshness</em> over a <em>timestamp</em> field which stores the epoch time in second resolution.
  For each content node, the top 50 hits from the first phase function is re-ranked using
  a trained <a href="xgboost.html">xgboost</a> model.
</p>



<h2 id="top-k-query-operators">Top-K Query Operators</h2>
<p>
  If the first-phase ranking function can be approximated as a simple linear function,
  and the query mode is <em>any</em>,
  the <a href="using-wand-with-vespa.html">Weak And/WAND</a> implementations in Vespa
  allows avoiding fully evaluating all the documents matching the query with the <em>first-phase</em> function.
  Instead, only the top K hits using the internal operator ranking will be exposed
  to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
</p><p>
  Both wand implementations accepts a targeted number of hits (top N).
  Each content node will expose all hits that were evaluated to the first-phase ranking function,
  while skipped documents will not.
  The skipped set are the ones that matches the query,
  but which cannot outperform any of the already collected hits on the internal scoring heap.
  Due to not fully evaluating all documents matching the query,
  the total hit count becomes inaccurate when using weakAnd/Wand.
</p><p>
  The <a href="nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a> operator is also a top k retrieval operator which does ranking (by distance) and retrieval
  in one process and exposes only a small subset of the matching documents to the <em>first-phase</em> ranking function.
</p>



<h2 id="choosing-phased-ranking-functions">Choosing phased ranking functions</h2>
<p>
A good ranking expression will for most applications consume too much CPU
to be runnable on the entire result set within the latency budget/SLA.
The application ranking function should hence in most cases be a second phase function.
The task then becomes to find a first phase function,
which correlates sufficiently well with the second phase function -
this to ensure that relevance is not hurt too much
by not evaluating the real ranking function on all the hits.
</p>



<h2 id="rank-phase-statistics">Rank phase statistics</h2>
<p>
  Use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#match-features">match-features</a>
  and <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>
  to export detailed match- and rank-information per query.
  This requires post-processing and aggregation is an external system for analysis.
</p>
<p>
  To evaluate how well the document corpus matches the queries,
  use <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#mutate">mutable attributes</a>
  to track how often each document survives each match- and ranking-phase.
  This is aggregated per document and makes it easy to analyse using the query and grouping APIs in Vespa -
  and no other processing/storage is required.
</p>
<p>
  A mutable attribute is a number where an operation can be executed in 4 phases:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>on-match</li>
  <li>on-first-phase</li>
  <li>on-second-phase</li>
  <li>on-summary</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The common use case is to increase the value by 1 for each execution.
  With this, it is easy to evaluate the document's performance to the queries,
  e.g. find the documents that appear in most queries, or the ones that never matched -
  run a query and order by the mutable attribute.
</p>
{% include note.html content='The mutable attributes are just counters and memory-operations only -
the values might or might not not survive content node restarts.
The values cannot be compared across nodes.
Use the values to assess relative document matching and ranking performance since Vespa start' %}
<p>
  This example is based on the <a href="vespa-quick-start.html">quickstart</a>.
  It uses 4 attributes that each track how many times a document participates in any of the 4 phases.
  This is tracked only if using rank-profile <code>rank_albums_track</code> in the query:
</p>
<pre>
schema music {

    document music {

        field artist type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }

        field album type string {
            indexing: summary | index
        }

        field year type int {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }

        field category_scores type tensor&lt;float&gt;(cat{}) {
            indexing: summary | attribute
        }

    }

    field match_count type long {
        indexing: attribute | summary
        attribute: mutable
    }
    field first_phase_count type long {
        indexing: attribute | summary
        attribute: mutable
    }
    field second_phase_count type long {
        indexing: attribute | summary
        attribute: mutable
    }
    field summary_count type long {
        indexing: attribute | summary
        attribute: mutable
    }

    fieldset default {
        fields: artist, album
    }

    rank-profile rank_albums inherits default {
        first-phase {
            expression: sum(query(user_profile) * attribute(category_scores))
        }
        second-phase {
            expression: attribute(year)
            rerank-count: 1
        }
    }

    rank-profile rank_albums_track inherits rank_albums {
        mutate {
            on-match        { match_count        += 1 }
            on-first-phase  { first_phase_count  += 1 }
            on-second-phase { second_phase_count += 1 }
            on-summary      { summary_count      += 1 }
        }
    }

    rank-profile rank_albums_reset_on_match inherits rank_albums {
        mutate {
            on-match        { match_count         = 0 }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<pre>
$ vespa query \
  "select * from music where album contains 'head'" \
  "ranking=rank_albums_track"
</pre>


<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>
  The framework is flexible in use, the normal use case is:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Reset the mutable attribute on all content nodes -
    use <a href="reference/query-api-reference.html#model.searchPath">searchPath</a>
    to make sure all nodes are reset by sending a query using a rank profile that resets the value. E.g.:
<pre>
$ for node in {0..5}; do vespa query \
    "select * from music where true" \
    "ranking=rank_albums_reset_on_match" \
    "model.searchPath=$node/0"; \
  done
</pre>
    Alternatively, run a query against a group
    and verify that <a href="reference/default-result-format.html">coverage</a> is 100%.
    <!-- ToDo: add note on what to do for the other mutable attributes -->
  </li>
  <li>
    Run query load, using the tracking rank-profile, like <code>rank_albums_track</code> above
  </li>
  <li>
    Run queries using <a href="reference/sorting.html">sorting</a> or <a href="grouping.html">grouping</a>
    on the mutable attributes.
  </li>
</ol>

{% include note.html content='Make sure that only the relevant query load uses the tracking rank profile.
E.g. exclude monitoring queries / automation by using a separate ranking profile.' %}

<p>
  To initialize a mutable attribute with a different value than 0 when a document is PUT, use:
</p>
<pre>
field match_count type long {
    indexing: 7 | to_long | attribute | summary   # Initialized to 7 for a new document. Default is 0.
    attribute: mutable
}
</pre>
<p>
  To dump values fast, from memory only (assuming the schema has an <code>id</code> field):
</p>
<pre>
document-summary rank_phase_statistics {
    summary id type int
    summary match_count type long
    summary first_phase_count type long
    summary second_phase_count type long
    summary summary_count type long
}
</pre>
<pre>
$ vespa query \
  "select * from music where true" \
  "presentation.summary=rank_phase_statistics"
</pre>
