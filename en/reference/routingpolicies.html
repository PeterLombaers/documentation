<p>
  This article contains detailed descriptions of the behaviour of all routing policies available in Vespa.
  There is also a more <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/routing.html">general article</a> on Vespa's routing model available.
</p><p>
  The <em>Document protocol</em> is currently the only Message Bus protocol supported by Vespa.
  Furthermore, all routing policies that are part of this protocol
  share a common code path for <a href="#merge">merging replies</a>.
  The policies offered by the protocol are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#and">AND</a> - Selects all configured recipient hops.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="#documentrouteselector">DocumentRouteSelector</a> - Uses a <a
    href="document-select-language.html">document selection string</a> to select compatible routes</li>
  <li><a href="#content">Content</a> - Selects a content cluster distributor based on system state</li>
  <li><a href="#messagetype">MessageType</a> - Selects a next hop based on message type</li>
  <li><a href="#extern">Extern</a> - Selects a recipient by querying a remote Vespa application</li>
  <li><a href="#localservice">LocalService</a> - Selects a recipient based on ip address</li>
  <li><a href="#roundrobin">RoundRobin</a> - Selects one from the configured recipients in round-robin order</li>
  <li><a href="#subsetservice">SubsetService</a> - Selects only among a subset of all matching services</li>
  <li><a href="#loadbalancer">LoadBalancer</a> - A round-robin policy that chooses between the recipients
    by generating a weight according to their performance</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="merge">Common Document <code>merge()</code> logic</h3>
<p>
  The shared merge logic of most Document routing policies is an attempt to
  do the "right" thing when merging multiple replies into one.
  It works by first stepping through all replies, storing their content as either:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>OK replies,</li>
  <li>IGNORE replies, or</li>
  <li>ERROR replies</li>
</ol>
<p>
If at least one ERROR reply is found, return a new reply that contains all the errors of the others.
If there is at least one OK reply, return the first OK reply,
but transfer all feed information from the others to this
(this is specific data for start- and end-of-feed messages).
Otherwise, return a new reply that contains all the IGNORE errors. Pseudocode:
</p>
<pre>
for each reply, do
    if reply has no errors, do
        store reply in OK list
    else, do
        if reply has only IGNORE errors
            copy all errors from reply to IGNORE list
        else, do
            copy all errors from reply to ERROR list

if ERROR list is not empty, do
    return new reply with all errors
else, do
    if OK list is not empty, do
        return first reply with all feed answers
    else, do
        return new reply with all IGNORE errors
</pre>

        This is a mostly a convenience policy
        that allows the user to fork a message's route to all configured recipients.
        It is not message-type aware, and will simply always select all recipients.
        Replies are merged according to the <a href="#merge">shared logic</a>.
        </p><p>
        The optional string parameter is parsed as a space-separated list of hops.
        Configured recipients have precedence over parameter-given recipients,
        although this is likely to be changed in the future.

        This policy is responsible for selecting among the policy's recipients
        according to the subscription rules defined by a content cluster's <em>documents</em> element
        in <a href="../reference/services.html">services.xml</a>.
        If the "selection" attribute is set in the "documents" element,
        its value is processed as a <a href="document-select-language.html">document select</a> string,
        and run on documents and document updates to determine routes.
        If the "feedname" attribute is set, all feed commands are filtered through it.
        </p><p>
        The recipient list of this policy is required to map directly to route names.
        E.g. if a recipient is "search/cluster.music", and a message is appropriate according to the selection criteria,
        the message is routed to the "search/cluster.music" route.
        If the route does not exist, this policy will reply with an error.
        In short, <u>this policy selects one or more recipient routes based on document content and configured criteria</u>.

        If more than one route is chosen, its replies are merged according to the <a href="#merge">shared logic</a>.

      <td><p id="extern">
        This policy implements the necessary logic to communicate with an external Vespa application
        and resolve a single service pattern using that other application's slobrok servers.
        Keep in mind that there might be some delay from the moment this policy is initially created
        and when it receives the response to its service query,
        so using this policy might cause a message to be resent a few times until it is resolved.
        If you disable retries, this policy might cause all messages to fail for the first seconds.
        </p><p>
        This policy uses its parameter for both the address of the extern slobrok server to connect to,
        and also the pattern to use for querying.
        The parameter is required to be on the form <code>&lt;spec&gt;;&lt;service&gt;</code>,
        where <code>spec</code> is a comma-separated list of slobrok connection specs
        on the form "tcp/hostname:port", and <code>service</code> is a service running on the remote Vespa application.

      <td><p id="localservice">
        This policy is used to select among all matching services,
        but preferring those running on the same host as the current one.
        The pattern used when querying for available services is the current one,
        but replacing the policy directive with an asterisk.
        E.g. the hop "docproc/cluster.default/[LocalService]/chain.default" would prefer local services
        among all those that match the pattern "docproc/cluster.default/*/chain.default".
        If there are multiple matching services that run locally,
        this policy will do simple round-robin load balancing between them.
        If no matching services run locally,
        this policy simply returns the asterisk as a match to allow the underlying network logic
        to do load balancing among all available.
        </p><p>
        This policy accepts an optional parameter which overrides the local hostname.
        Use this if you wish the hop to prefer some specific host.

        This policy is used to select among a configured set of recipients.
        For each configured recipient, this policy determines what online services are matched,
        and then selects one among all of those in round-robin order.
        If none of the configured recipients match any available service,
        this policy returns an error that indicates to the sender that it should retry later.
        </p><p>
        Because this policy only selects a single recipient, it contains no merging logic.

      <th>SubsetService</th>
      <td><p id="subsetservice">
        This policy is used to select among a subset of all matching services,
        and is used to minimize number of connections in the system.
        The pattern used when querying for available services is the current one,
        but replacing the policy directive with an asterisk.
        E.g. the hop "docproc/cluster.default/[SubsetService:3]/chain.default"
        would select among a subset of all those that match the pattern "docproc/cluster.default/*/chain.default".
        Given that the pattern returns a set of matches,
        this policy stores a subset of these based on the hash-value of the running message bus'
        connection string (this is unique for each instance).
        If there are no matching services,
        this policy returns the asterisk as a match to allow the underlying network logic to fail gracefully.
        </p><p>
        This policy parses its optional parameter as the size of the subset.
        If none is given, the subset defaults to size 5.

        This policy is used to send to a stateless cluster such as docproc,
        where any node can be chosen to process any message.
        Messages are sent between the nodes in a round-robin fashion,
        but each node is assigned a weight based on its performance.
        The weights are calculated by measuring the number of times the node had a full input-queue
        and returned a busy response.
        Use this policy to send to docproc clusters that have nodes with different performance characteristics.
